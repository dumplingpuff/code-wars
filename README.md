# Welcome to My Code Wars Workshop

When solving problems I usually like to do it in a text editor where I
can mark down my thoughts and began the problem solving process. In the
future when I organize my files properly, maybe you can see the growth
and evolution in my code. Enjoy.

## Why Codewars and What Is It?

Those who don't know codewars, it's a great website to really polish your
problem solving skills. Sometimes you might feel that you are jumping
down a rabbit hole, wasting all this time exploring some specialized
functions.  While that is true, it is worth it.  I do see returns
in how I approach problems on while working on my own projects.
The trick is to look at other people's solution once you have solved
the problem and try to adapt what interests you to your own style of
coding.  If you don't have an account please check it out.
** Warning many people often complain about how hard it is, don't let
it turn you away.
